* P’undrak’s Constructed Languages
Hi, I’m P’undrak (pronounced {{{phon(pʰynɖak̚)}}}), also known as Lucien
Cartier-Tilet. I create constructed languages and worlds, both for fun
and for my literary universe. As you might have guessed with the name
of this website, you will find here the documentation of my public
constructed languages. If you want to know more about me, you can head
to my [[https://phundrak.com/en][main website]].
