* Proto-Ñyqy

The documentation is about a conlang I created. However, it will be
written as an in-universe document would be. Therefore, any reference
to other works, documents or people will be completely fictional. If
there is somewhere written along the lines of “there needs to be more
research done on the subject”, this simply means I haven’t written
anything on this subject, and I may or may not plan to. As you might
notice, the style of writing in this document will be inspired mainly
by the book /Indo-European Language and Culture/ by Benjamin W. Forston.
Go read this book if you haven’t already, it’s extremely interesting
(except for the part with the Old Irish and Vedic people and what
their kings and queens did with horses, I wish to unread that).
