**** Cases in Modern Eittlandic
Although seldom visible, as described in [[file:./syntax.md#case-marking][Case Marking]], cases still
remain part of the Eittlandic grammar, expressed through its syntax
rather than explicit marking on its nouns and adjectives. Four
different grammatical cases exist in this language: the *nominative*,
*accusative*, *genitive*, and *dative* case.
- The *nominative* case represents the subject of a sentence, that is,
  the subject of intransitive clauses and the agent of transitive
  clauses. As we’ll see below, it is morphologically marked only in
  dialects other than Standard Eittlandic, and only if the word is a
  strong masculine word.
- On the other hand *accusative*, like Old Norse, usually marks the
  object of a verb, but it can also express time-related ideas such as
  a duration in time, or after some prepositions. It is also the
  default case when a noun has no clear status in a clause, and it can
  as such serve as a vocative.
- *Dative* usually marks indirect objects of verbs in Old Norse, though
  it can also often mark direct objects depending on the verb used.

**** Case Marking
Although present in Early Old Norse, the use of grammatical cases has
been on the decline since the Great Vowel Shift (see [[file:phonology.md#great-vowel-shift][Phonology: Great
Vowel Shift]]). Due to the general loss of word-final short vowels and
to regularization of its nouns, Eittlandic lost almost all of weak
nouns’ inflexions and a good amount in its strong nouns’ inflexions.
On top of this, the root of most nouns got regularized, getting rid of
former umlauts. Hence, while in Old Norse one might find the table
below presented in Cleasby and Vigfusson (1874), Modern Eittlandic is
simplified to the table following it.

|   |       Dat. | heim-um       | skip-um       | tím-um     |

As you can see, a good amount of declensions disappeared from nouns,
with only four marked cases for strong common nouns and two for strong
neuter and weak nouns. The declension system completely merged weak
nouns which are no longer distinguished by gender. Strong masculine
and strong feminine also got merged into strong common.

Declensions are no longer productive in almost all Modern Eittlandic
dialects. They are still mostly used in formal and written speech, but
they are less and less used in less formal circumstances and in oral
speech. The Royal Academy for Literature, which authored Standard
Eittlandic, even recommends not using grammatical cases when using
this dialect as they are reduntand with other syntactic strategies.
While the recommendation is mostly followed, speakers still tend to
use the singular genetive declension oraly. Younger folks at the time
of writing even tend to regularize it as /-ar/ for strong neuter and
weak nouns.

The only exception to declensions no longer being productive is in the
Hylfjaltr Kingdom’s exclave in southern Eittland where speakers of its
local dialect tend instead to favor strong nouns for newer terms.
Hence, while most dialects agree on “internet” (pl.nom /internetr/,
pl.dat /internetum/) being a weak noun, this dialect treats it as either
a strong feminine (sg.gen /internetar/, pl.nom&acc /internetr/, pl.dat
/internetum/) or a strong neuter (sg.gen /internets/, pl.dat /internetum/)
--- the difference is due to subdivisions in said dialect, mainly
between rural and urban areas favoring the former and the latter
respectively.

There are some regular exceptions to the declension system. The first
one, inherited from Old Norse, is the /-r/ suffix becoming /-n/ or /-l/ when
a noun ends with an «n» or an «l» respectively, hence the table below
showing the declensions of strong masculine /himn/ (/heaven/) and strong
feminine /hafn/ (/harbour/, /haven/).
#+name: tbl:irregular-noun-declensions
|        <r> |        |        |
|            | himn   | hafn   |

|       Acc. | himn   | hafn   |
|       Gen. | himnar | hafnar |
|       Dat. | himnum | hafnum |

During the last five centuries, the root of the word got regularized
so that only one or two forms are allowed. Due to umlaut or ablaut, it
is possible the main vowel of a word changes between its singular and
plural form, even sometimes affecting its dative form. These changes
are due to old vowels long gone since --- with most even gone by the
time of Old Norse. These changes mainly remains in a few common words.
The table below gives some examples of such irregularities. These
words are marked as irregular in the dictionary.

*** Articles and Demonstratives
# - Do noun phrases have articles?
# - If so, are they obligatory or optional, and under what
#   circumstances do they occur?
# - Are they separate words, or bound morphemes?
# - Is there a class of classes of demonstratives as distinct from
#   articles?
# - How many degrees of distance are there in the system of
#   demontsratives?
# - Are there other distinctions beside distances?

When the noun of a nominal group is not a mass noun or a proper noun,
an article must accompany it, except for indefinite plural nouns.

**** Indefinite Article
The indefinite article is /einn/, the same term as /one/ in Eittlandic. It
agrees in declension with its noun, though it is to be noted its
declension is irregular, as seen in table below. Similarly, other
numerals have declensions as discussed in [[file:word-structure-and-classes.md#numerals][Word Classes: Numerals]].
#+name: tbl:declension-einn
|      | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------+-----------+----------+--------|
| Nom. | einn      | ein      | eit    |
| Acc. | ein       | ein      | eit    |
| Dat. | ein       | einn     | eits   |
| Gen. | einn      | ein      | eit    |

**** Definite articles
As in other scandinavian languages, definite articles in Eittlandic
act as suffixes to the noun and fully replace its declension as it has
case marking itself. The full declension table of definite articles
can be found in the table below. As we can see, the definite articles
underwent an important regularization as well as merging strong neuter
and weak nouns together.
#+name: tbl:definite-articles
| / |        <r> |               |                              |
|   |            | Strong Common | Strong Neuter and Weak Nouns |
|---+------------+---------------+------------------------------|
|   | Sing. Nom. | -(i)nn        | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Acc. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Gen. | -(i)ns        | -(i)ts                       |
|   |       Dat. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   | Plur. Nom. | -(i)nn        | -(i)tr                       |
|   |       Acc. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Gen. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Dat. | -(i)num       | -(i)tum                      |

The initial /i/ is only used when using the definite articles as a
suffix would cause a consonant cluster forbidden by Eittlandic
phonology, otherwise it is omitted. An example of the former case is
with /vatn/ (/water/) which becomes /vatnits/ when in its definite singular
genitive form, while /øy/ (/island/) becomes /øyns/ in the same form. Like
the indefinite article, the suffix agrees in gender, agreeing either
with strong masculine or feminine words (or as established before,
strong common) or with strong neuter and weak nouns.

The use of definite articles with nouns is further discussed in
[[file:./syntax.md#definiteness][Definiteness]].

*** Definiteness
Definiteness in Eittlandic serves multiple purposes. Its most obvious
one is to distinguish between an indefinite and a definite entity, as
in English /a dog/ or /the dog/, respectively /einn hundr/ and /hundinn/, as
discussed in [[file:./syntax.md#articles-and-demonstratives][Articles and Demonstratives]].

However, definiteness is also necessary with suffixed possessives and
demonstrative.

*** Possessives
# - How are possessors expressed in the noun phrase?
# - Do nouns agree with their possessors? Do possessors agree with
#   possessed nouns? Neither, or both?
# - Is there a distinction between alienable and inalienable
#   possesson?
# - Are there other types of possession?
# - When the possessor is a full noun, where does it usually come with
#   respect to the possessed noun?
*** Gender
# - Is there a noun class system?
# - What are the classes and how are they manifested in the noun
#   phrase?
# - What dimension of reality is most central to the noun class system
#   (e.g. animacy, shape, function, etc.)? What other dimensions are
#   relevant?
# - Do the classifiers occur with numerals? Adjectives? Verbs?
# - What is their function in these contexts?
Eittlandic inherited from Old Norse a gender system divided into three
genders: male, female, and neuter. Although the number of elements
marking it declined during its evolution, Eittlandic still marks
gender in its strong nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and to a certain
degree in its articles. However, as mentioned in [[file:./syntax.md#case-marking][Case Marking]], case
marking and by extensions gender marking is slowly disappearing in
Modern Eittlandic nouns and adjectives.

Due to the presence of declensions with strong nouns and adjectives,
its pronouns, and to a certain degree different articles, it can still
be said Eittlandic is a gendered language, although it doesn’t hold
much importance in its grammar anymore. Since strong nouns aren’t
productive anymore and weak nouns lost all obvious gender differences,
we can even consider gender as not productive anymore in Eittlandic
and bound to eventually disappear. In fact, the loss of gender is even
stronger in Standard Eittlandic due to the theoretical absence of
declensions in this dialect.

In case a strong noun is used with a strong adjective, both will agree
in number and gender.

  - hvítr hund

    white.m.sg.acc dog.m.sg.acc

    white dog
  - langir tungir

    long.f.pl.acc tongues.f.pl.acc
