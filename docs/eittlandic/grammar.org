**** Personal Pronouns

| Acc. | mik | þik | oss | yðr |
| Dat. | mér | þér | oss | yðr |
| Gen. | mín | þín | vár | yðr |

The only notable change in written form from their Early Old Norse
version is the regularization of the genitive plural second person
/yðar/ into /yðr/. Otherwise, most changes only happened regarding their
phonology as explained in [[file:./phonology.md#evolution-from-early-old-norse-to-eittlandic][the evolution from Early Old Norse to
Eittlandic]].

#+name: 3-personal-pronouns-table
#+caption: Third person pronouns in Eittlandic
|         | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|---------+-----------+----------+--------|
| Sg.Nom. | hann      | han      | þat    |
| Sg.Acc. | han       | han      | þat    |
| Sg.Dat. | hanum     | henn     | því    |

| Pl.Acc. | þá        | þér      | þau    |
| Pl.Dat. | þeim      | þeim     | þeim   |
| Pl.Gen. | þeir      | þeir     | þeir   |

Here we also have few changes from the Early Old Norse pronouns for
the third persons, singular and plural.

An additional set of pronouns contains reflexive pronouns. This one is
relatively small, as it does not agree in person, number, or gender.
However, it still agrees in case. Note that there is no nominative
reflexive pronoun in Eittlandic.
| Nom | -   |
| Acc | sik |
| Dat | sér |
| Gen | sín |

**** Demonstrative Pronouns
During its evolution from Old Eittlandic, the Eittlandic language lost
one set of demonstrative pronouns, the one containing /sé/ in Old
Eittlandic and Old Norse, in favour of the sets containing /hinn/ and
/þessi/. Thus, we have these two sets in Eittlandic.

|        | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|--------+-----------+----------+--------|
| Sg Nom | hinn      | hinn     | hitt   |
| Sg Acc | hin       | hin      | hitt   |
| Sg Dat | hinum     | hin      | hin    |
| Sg Gen | hins      | hins     | hins   |
|--------+-----------+----------+--------|
| Pl Nom | hiner     | hiner    | hin    |
| Pl Acc | hin       | hiner    | hin    |
| Pl Dat | hinum     | hinum    | hinum  |
| Pl Gen | hinn      | hinn     | hinn   |

It is interesting to see that this set of pronouns retained some
differences between their masculine and feminine form, which has
become quite rare in Modern Eittlandic. These are used similarly to
“that” or “those” in English, designating elements or things that are
judged as distant by the speaker from themselves.

On the other hand, the following pronouns containing /þess/ relate to
the words “this” and “these” in English.

**** Possessive Pronouns
Possessive pronouns in Eittlandic simply are the genitive form of the
personal pronouns shown [[file:./grammar.md#personal-pronouns][above]]. The pronoun agrees with the owner in
person and number, and in gender when the third person is used, as in
English.

They generally replace a whole nominative proposition, such as with
the example below.

#+html: ::: tip Example
– Havir þú historiabøk?
– Ek haft gleymt mín
#+html: :::

You can compare them to English possessive pronouns like /mine/, /yours/,
or /theirs/.

# That’s possessive adjectives, move it in the right header

# The first and more formal usage, inherited from Old Norse, is to
# precede the noun phrase owned by the owner with the genitive pronoun.
# For instance, /mín katt/ means /my cat/ while /þeim katt/ means /their cat/
# (as shown in [[file:./grammar.md#case-marking][Case Marking]], we have no way to know if /katt/, a strong
# common word, is singular or plural accusative).

# The second and more casual way to express possession is using the
# definite form of a word and placing the possessive pronoun after it.
# We can adapt the previous examples of /my cat/ and /their cat/ as /kattin
# mín/ and /kattin þeim/.

# While these two forms provide a difference in tone, the second form is
# more limited as it only allows single word noun phrases to be the
# possessed element while the first allows more complex noun phrases.
# The sentence /mín kattrinn komand frá heim/ (/my cat coming from home/)
# would need to be modified in order to fit the second structure, such
# as /kattrinn mín, hvar komr frá heim/ (/my cat, who is coming from home/).

*** Verbs
# - What are the distributional properties of verbs?
# - What are the structural properties of verbs?
# - What are the major subclasses of verbs?
# - Describe the order of various verbal operators within the verbal
#   word or verb phrase.
# - Give charts of the tense/aspect/mode, etc. Indicate major
#   allomorphic variants.
# - Are directional and/or locational notions expressed in the verb or
#   verb phrase at all?
#   - Is this operation obligatory, i.e. does one member of the
#     paradigm have to occur in every finite verb or verb phrase?
#   - Is it productiv
#     verb stems, and does it have the same meaning with each one?
#     (Nothing is fully productive, but some operations are more
#     productive than others.)
#   - Is this operation primarily coded morphologically, analytically,
#     or lexically? Are there any exceptions to the general case?
#   - Where in the verb phrase or verbal word is this operation likely
#     to appear? Can it occur in more than one place?
Eittlandic, as most if not all North Germanic language, is a V2
language. This implies that in most cases, the verb in sentences will
come at the second position, possibly moving its subject right between
the verb itself and the rest of the verb phrase. The only exception to
this are questions and the use of imperative. More on that later.

Since Early Old Norse, Eittlandic evolved its verb both towards
simplification on one hand, making the verb endings a lot more regular
and predictable, and complexification with the addition of new moods
and tenses.

**** Infinitive
The infinitive form of verbs in Eittlandic is generally used when the
verbal phrase it is part of is treated as the object of another
phrase, similarly to how infinitive works in other Nordic languages or
English. For instance, “he likes to eat” translates to “hann líkar
eta” ({{{phon(hanː lèkar̩ et)}}}), where “eta” is the object of the verbs
“líkar”. This form is the one given in the dictionary and undergoes no
inflexion.

**** Imperative
The imperative has the same form as the infinitive in Eittlandic. The
evolution of the Eittlandic language made it lose the second singular
and plural distinction, leaving the same form for both. Eittlandic
verbs also evolved in such a way most, if not all, of them have the
same form as their infinitive counterpart.

  | eat.IMP | food-DEF.ACC | 2p.GEN |

**** Participles
Formation of participles is relatively simple in Eittlandic is pretty
simple, as it simply adds /-and/ and /-it/ to the verbal root of the verb
in order to form the present participle and the past participle
respectively.

#+name: verb-participle-declension
#+caption: Formation of Eittlandic Participles
| Present Participle | -and |
| Past Participle    | -it  |

**** Indicative
Indicative the only non-irrealis mood available in Eittlandic. It is
used to express events or facts that are happening or happened with
certainty from the speaker’s point of view. This mood only exists for
the present, progressive, preterit, and perfect tenses. Other tenses,
such as future, exist in other moods as explained below.

The first two basic tenses are the present and past tenses. The
present tense in Eittlandic is relatively similar to the English
present tense, as it can describe what the speaker perceives as
general truths, habitual facts, events that are happening at the same
time as the time of speech, or current facts. It can also indicate
events when the English language would use the progressive mood
instead. Eittlandic does have a progressive mood of its own, though
slightly different, see [[file:./grammar.md#progressive][below]]. Lastly, it can also express near future
when other clues are available in the discourse.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Í Eittland, vér snakk eittlandsk.

  In Eittland, we speak Eittlandic.
#+html: :::

Here is how the typical verb is inflected in the indicative mood:

#+name: verb-indicative-inflexion-table
#+caption: Typical Verb Inflexion in the Indicative Mood
|  <c>   |   |            |           |
| person |   | Ind. Pres. | Ind. Past |
|--------+---+------------+-----------|
|   1s   |   | -(V)r      | -t        |
|   2s   |   | -(V)r      | -t        |
|   3s   |   | -(V)r      | -t        |
|   1p   |   | -um        | -um       |
|   2p   |   | -ið        | -uð       |
|   3p   |   | -ið        | -uð       |

An important feature to note is /-(V)r/ makes the underlying final vowel
of a verb appear, while it is otherwise lost in all other contexts.
For instance, the verb /lík/ becomes /líkar/ when in singular indicative
present, but /líkt/ when in singular indicative past.

Here are the indicative present declensions of the verbs /far(a)/ (/to
go/, a strong verb), and /berja/ (/to beat/, a weak verb):

#+name: verb-inflexion-ind-example
#+caption: Indicative present inflexion of /far(a)/ and /berja/
| person |   | far   | berja  |
|--------+---+-------+--------|
| 1s     |   | ferar | berjar |
| 2s     |   | ferar | berjar |
| 3s     |   | ferar | berjar |
| 1p     |   | farum | berjum |
| 2p     |   | farið | berið  |
| 3p     |   | farið | berið  |

Note that the final vowel of /berja/ gets replaced with the vowel from
the inflexion, and the final /j/ also disappears when it is immediately
followed by an /i/.

**** Subjunctive
The subjunctive is the default irrealis mood of Eittlandic. Like the indicative mood, it has two tenses, present and past, in which verbs get inflexions. Below is the table showing how verbs typically inflect in the subjunctive mood:

#+name: verb-subjunctive-inflexion-table
#+caption: Typical Verb Inflexion in the Subjunctive Mood
|  <c>   |   |             |            |
| person |   | Subj. Pres. | Subj. Past |
|--------+---+-------------+------------|
|   1s   |   | -ir         | -t         |
|   2s   |   | -ir         | -t         |
|   3s   |   | -ir         | -t         |
|   1p   |   | -im         | -um        |
|   2p   |   | -ið         | -uð        |
|   3p   |   | -ið         | -uð        |

As you can see, the subjunctive past form of verbs is identical to
their indicative past form, as shown below.

#+name: verb-inflexion-past-example
#+caption: Indicative and Subjunctive Past Inflexion of /far(a)/ and /berja/
| person |   | far   | berja  |
|--------+---+-------+--------|
| 1s     |   | fert  | berjat |
| 2s     |   | fert  | berjat |
| 3s     |   | fert  | berjat |
| 1p     |   | farum | berjum |
| 2p     |   | faruð | berjuð |
| 3p     |   | faruð | berjuð |

**** Perfect
The perfect aspect in Eittlandic is relatively similar to the modern
past form of the language. It also uses the verbs /ver/ and /hav/ before
the verb, which both agree in number, tense, and mood instead of the
main verb which appears in its participle form. The present participle
is used when the event relates to the present or the future, while the
past participle is used when the event relates to a time in the past.

 It also uses the verbs /ver/ and /hav/ before
the verb, which both agree in number, tense, and mood instead of the
main verb. The latter, on the other hand, appears in its participle
form, present or past depending on whether the action is happening or
will happen, or if it happened in the past.

**** Passive
The passive voice, inherited from the /-sk/ form in Old Norse, has some
more regular declension than the other moods. However, this is the
last declension where we can still see the remains of the distinction
between strong and weak verbs inherited from Old Norse.

#+name: passive-declension-table
#+caption: Strong and Weak Verb Inflexion for the Indicative Present and Past in Passive Voice
|  <c>   |   |          |             |

|--------+---+----------+-------------|
|   1s   |   | -umk     | -umk        |
|   2s   |   | -(a/i)sk | -(ð/d/t)isk |
|   3s   |   | -(a/i)sk | -(ð/d/t)isk |
|   1p   |   | -umk     | -umk        |
|   2p   |   | -(a/i)sk | -(ð/d/t)isk |
|   3p   |   | -(a/i)sk | -(ð/d/t)isk |

#+name: passive-example-table
#+caption: Example of passive with /far/ and /berja/
| person |   | far    | berja     |
|--------+---+--------+-----------|

| 2s     |   | ferisk | berjaðisk |
| 3s     |   | ferisk | berjaðisk |
| 1p     |   | farumk | berjumk   |
| 2p     |   | farask | berjaðisk |
| 3p     |   | farask | berjaðisk |

Due to this uniformization of the passive voice in Eittlandic,
Eittlanders began using the verbs /ver(a)/ and /hav(a)/ (respectively /to
be/ and /to have/) as auxiliaries preceding the verb in order to convey
the subject, tense, and mood agreement. The verb /ver(a)/ is most often
used in active verbs, while the verb /hav(a)/ is generally used with
stative verbs. While all verbs have a default auxiliary, such as
/ver(a)/ for a verb like /et(a)/ (/to eat/), the speaker may choose to use
the other auxiliary in order to increase or decrease the agency of the
semantic agent (not the syntactic agent), even if it is not present in
the sentence.

  | 1s.NOM | have.1s.IND.PST | burn-1s.PAS | 1s.ACC |
  /I got burnt/
#+html: :::

**** Progressive
The progressive mood is generally used to express an ongoing action at
the time of speech. Note that its usage is a bit different from
English, as Eittlandic progressive is rarer in spoken Eittlandic and
even rarer in written Eittlandic. It is generally used to disambiguate
a sentence that could be either indicative or progressive, but is
usually omitted when the speaker feels like the progressive mood
should be obvious enough.

To mark the progressive, the word /ná/ is placed just after the verb,
without any other word between them.

**** Conditional
The conditional mood allows speakers of Eittlandic to speak about
conditional events while marking them as such. This translates into
several strategies.

The first strategy adds /-(u)sk(a)-/ between the verb root and its
indicative declension. It marks conditionals the speakers estimates to
be unlikely.

The jussive is percieved as a more subtle, more formal form of the
[[file:./grammar.md#imperative][imperative]]. It is formed by adding /-(i)l/ at the end of the verbal
root.

**** Dubitative
The dubitative mood in Eittlandic is a mood used by the speaker to
express doubt or uncertainty. It is formed by inserting /-(a)kki/
between the verbal root and the indicative declension. It translates
to this declension table:

Verbs in Eittlandic agree with their subject in person and number,
though it lost a lot of its diversity Old Norse had. It also varies
depending on the tense, mood, and aspect of the verbal sentence. The

| 1p     |   | farim | berim |
| 2p     |   | farið | berið |
| 3p     |   | farið | berið |

We can see again how the /ja/ at the end of infinitive /berja/ got
replaced by the ending of subjunctive present verbs.

The past declension is simpler as there is no difference between
indicative and subjunctive past.

| 1p     |   | farum | berjum |
| 2p     |   | faruð | berjuð |
| 3p     |   | faruð | berjuð |

The infinitive and imperative merged due to the final vowel loss,
making /far/ and /berja/ not only the infinitive form of /to go/ and /to
beat/, but also their imperative form. Present and past participles are
on the other hand made by appending /-and/ and /-it/ respectively.

| infinitive / imperative | far    | berja   |
| present participle      | farand | berjand |
| past participle         | farit  | berit   |

When it comes to the passive voice, inherited from the /-sk/ form in Old
Norse, its declension is a lot more regular. However, we’ll see the
remaining difference between strong and weak verbs.

| 1p     |   | farumk | berjumk   |
| 2p     |   | farask | berjaðisk |
| 3p     |   | farask | berjaðisk |

There is only one minor difference for the subjunctive mood: both the
first-person singular and plural change to /-imk/ instead of /-umk/.
Imperative, on the other hand, only works with the second person in
the present tense by appending an /-sk/ at the end of the infinitive of
the verb.

Due to this uniformization of the passive voice in Eittlandic,
Eittlanders began using the verbs /ver(a)/ and /hav(a)/ (respectively /to
be/ and /to have/) as auxiliaries preceding the verb in order to convey
the subject, tense, and mood agreement. The verb /ver(a)/ is most often
used in active verbs, while the verb /hav(a)/ is generally used with
stative verbs. While all verbs have a default auxiliary, such as
/ver(a)/ for a verb like /et(a)/ (/to eat/), the speaker may choose to use
the other auxiliary in order to increase or decrease the agency of the
semantic agent (not the syntactic agent), even if it is not present in
the sentence.

The verbs /var(a)/ and /hav(a)/ are irregular verbs that do not follow the
same inflexion rules. For a list of their inflexion, see their
dictionary entry ([[file:./dictionary.md#ver-a][ver(a)]] and [[file:./dictionary.md#hav-a][hav(a)]]).

The passive voice inherits from the Old Norse mediopassive voice. It
is often used to promote a semantic patient to a syntactic agent and
to demote a semantic agent to a syntactic oblique, sometimes even
completely removing it from the sentence.

Questions in Eittlandic are formed by inverting the syntactic subject
with its verb in a normal sentence. For example, the sentence /hann
komr í dag með faðin hans/ (/he’s coming today with his father/) becomes
a question when inverting /hann/ and /komr/. This is generally regarded as
a formal way of forming questions.

A more formal way of creating a question is by suffixing /-vit/ at the
end of a verb without any change to the word order of the sentence. If
there is any declension at the end of the verb, /-vit/ will bear it
instead of the stem of the verb itself. It is somewhat similar to
asking a question in English by simply raising the sentence’s tone.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Hann komr í dag með faðin hans

  | hann     | kom-r           | í dag | með  | fað-in         | hans     |
  | 3s.m.NOM | come-s.PRES.IND | today | with | father.ACC-DEF | 3s.m.GEN |

  He’s coming with his father today.
- Komr han í dag með faðin hans?

  | come-s.PRES.IND | 3s.m.NOM | today | with | father.ACC-DEF | 3s.m.GEN |

  | 3s.m.NOM | come-Q-s.PRES.IND | today | with | father.ACC-DEF | 3s.m.GEN |

  He’s coming with his father today?
#+html: :::

The verbs /ver(a)/ and /hav(a)/ both cannot use this construction.
Instead, Eittlandic speakers may instead simply add /vit/ as a
standalone word at the end of the question.

- Hann er konung.

  | hann     | er             | konung   |

#+html: :::

**** Yes/No questions
Yes/no questions are generally answered by /já/ or /nei/ (/yes/ or /no/
respectively), sometimes with a repeat of the core of the sentence to
confirm the reply.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Komr han í dag með faðin hans?

  Is he coming today with his father?

- Nei, han komr eig

  No, he’s not coming
or
- Já, han komr

  Yes, he’s coming
#+html: :::

The interjections /já/ and /nei/ are often ambiguous when replying to a
question employing a negative verb and are often avoided; Eittlanders
will prefer to reply with part of or the entirety of the question with
either a negative marker or not to confirm or deny the assumption of
the question.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Komr han eig í dag?

  Is he not coming today?

- Han komr eig

  He’s not coming
or
- Han komr
#+html: :::

Another strategy, a lot more common when replying to negative
questions, is to reply using counter-factual interjection /eng/ meaning
/yes/, while speakers will consider a simple /nei/ as an approbation of
the assumption of the question.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Komr han eig í dag?

  Is he not coming today?

- Nei (han komr eig)

  No (he’s not coming)
or
- Áng (han komr)

  Yes he is coming
#+html: :::

Similarly, when a question with a positive assumption is asked,
Eittlandic speakers can answer with a counter-factual /náng/ to insist
on its erroneous nature.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Komr han eig í dag?

  Is he not coming today?

- Náng (han komr eig)

  Of course not (he’s not coming)
#+html: :::

Some yes/no questions are sometimes asked in a very reduced form,
without a full verbal sentence and only consisting of a noun phrase.
Think of questions like /Coffee?/ or /Another cookie?/ in English. Such
questions in Eittlandic require the final word /vit/.

#+html: ::: tip Example
- Té ell kafé vit?

  Tea or coffe?
- Té, þakk.

  Tea, please/thanks.
#+html: :::

**** General questions
General questions that are not yes/no questions will most of the time
begin with a question word such as /hvar/ (/who/), the equivalent of WH
words in English.

**** Cases in Modern Eittlandic
Although seldom visible, as described in [[file:grammar.md#case-marking][Case Marking]], cases still
remain part of the Eittlandic grammar, expressed through its syntax
rather than explicit marking on its nouns and adjectives. Four
different grammatical cases exist in this language: the *nominative*,
*accusative*, *genitive*, and *dative* case.
- The *nominative* case represents the subject of a sentence, that is,
  the subject of intransitive clauses and the agent of transitive
  clauses. As we’ll see below, it is morphologically marked only in
  dialects other than Standard Eittlandic, and only if the word is a
  strong masculine word.
- On the other hand *accusative*, like Old Norse, usually marks the
  object of a verb, but it can also express time-related ideas such as
  a duration in time, or after some prepositions. It is also the
  default case when a noun has no clear status in a clause, and it can
  as such serve as a vocative.
- *Dative* usually marks indirect objects of verbs in Old Norse, though
  it can also often mark direct objects depending on the verb used.

**** Case Marking
Although present in Early Old Norse, the use of grammatical cases has
been on the decline since the Great Vowel Shift (see [[file:phonology.md#great-vowel-shift][Phonology: Great
Vowel Shift]]). Due to the general loss of word-final short vowels and
to regularization of its nouns, Eittlandic lost almost all of weak
nouns’ inflexions and a good amount in its strong nouns’ inflexions.
On top of this, the root of most nouns got regularized, getting rid of
former umlauts. Hence, while in Old Norse one might find the table
below presented in Cleasby and Vigfusson (1874), Modern Eittlandic is
simplified to the table following it.

As you can see, a good amount of declensions disappeared from nouns,
with only four marked cases for strong common nouns and two for strong
neuter and weak nouns. The declension system completely merged weak
nouns which are no longer distinguished by gender. Strong masculine
and strong feminine also got merged into strong common.

We end up with the following declension system in Eittlandic.

#+name: tbl:eittlandic-noun-inflexion

|   |       Gen. | -(a)r         | -s            | -s         |

The /-ar/ ending drops the /a/ when an underlying ending vowel is present
in a word, as with /dótt/ (daughter) becoming /dóttir/ in its genitive
form. In some regions of Eittland, such as in the area of Vátrsteinn,
a strong neuter / weak noun merger is in effect, where strong neuter
merged into weak nouns. In the area of Hvítvall in North Western
Eastern Eittland, a complete merger between the three types of nouns
happened around the 1850s, where everything is declined as a weak
noun.

Nethertheless, declensions are no longer productive in most Modern
Eittlandic dialects. They are still mostly used in formal and written
speech, but they are less and less frequently used in less formal
circumstances and in oral speech. The Royal Academy for Literature,
which authored the Standard Eittlandic, even recommends not using
grammatical cases when using this dialect as they are seen as
reduntand with other syntactic strategies. While the recommendation is
mostly followed, speakers still tend to use the singular genetive
declension oraly. Younger folks at the time of writing even tend to
regularize it as /-ar/ for strong neuter and weak nouns.

One exception to declensions no longer being productive is in and
around the Hylfjaltr Kingdom exclave in southern Eittland where
speakers of its local dialect tend instead to favour strong nouns for
newer terms. Hence, while most dialects agree on “internet” (pl.nom
/internetr/, pl.dat /internetum/) being a weak noun, this dialect treats
it as either a strong feminine (sg.gen /internetar/, pl.nom&acc
/internetr/, pl.dat /internetum/) or a strong neuter (sg.gen /internets/,
pl.dat /internetum/) --- the difference is due to subdivisions in said
dialect, mainly between rural and urban areas favouring the former and
the latter respectively.

There are some regular exceptions to the declension system. The first
one, inherited from Old Norse, is the /-r/ suffix becoming /-n/ or /-l/ when
a noun ends with an «n» or an «l» respectively, hence the table below
showing the declensions of strong masculine /himn/ (/heaven/) and strong
feminine /hafn/ (/harbour/, /haven/).

During the last five centuries, the root of the word got regularized
so that only one or two forms are allowed. Due to umlaut or ablaut, it
is possible the main vowel of a word changes between its singular and
plural form, even sometimes affecting its dative form. These changes
are due to old vowels long gone since --- with most even gone by the
time of Old Norse. These changes mainly remains in a few common words.
The table below gives some examples of such irregularities. These
words are marked as irregular in the dictionary.

*** Articles and Demonstratives
# - Do noun phrases have articles?
# - If so, are they obligatory or optional, and under what
#   circumstances do they occur?
# - Are they separate words, or bound morphemes?
# - Is there a class of classes of demonstratives as distinct from
#   articles?
# - How many degrees of distance are there in the system of
#   demontsratives?
# - Are there other distinctions beside distances?

When the noun of a nominal group is not a mass noun or a proper noun,
an article must accompany it, except for indefinite plural nouns.

**** Indefinite Article
The indefinite article is /einn/, the same term as /one/ in Eittlandic. It
agrees in declension with its noun, though it is to be noted its
declension is irregular, as seen in table below. Similarly, other
numerals have declensions as discussed in [[file:grammar.md#numerals][Word Classes: Numerals]].
#+name: tbl:declension-einn
|      | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------+-----------+----------+--------|
| Nom. | einn      | ein      | eit    |
| Acc. | ein       | ein      | eit    |
| Dat. | einn      | ein      | eit    |
| Gen. | ein       | einn     | eits   |

**** Definite articles
As in other Scandinavian languages, definite articles in Eittlandic
act as suffixes to the noun and fully replace its declension as it has
case marking itself. The full declension table of definite articles
can be found in the table below. As we can see, the definite articles
underwent an important regularization as well as merging strong neuter
and weak nouns together.
#+name: tbl:definite-articles
| / |        <r> |               |                              |
|   |            | Strong Common | Strong Neuter and Weak Nouns |
|---+------------+---------------+------------------------------|
|   | Sing. Nom. | -(i)nn        | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Acc. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Dat. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Gen. | -(i)ns        | -(i)ts                       |
|   | Plur. Nom. | -(i)nn        | -(i)tr                       |
|   |       Acc. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |
|   |       Dat. | -(i)num       | -(i)tum                      |
|   |       Gen. | -(i)n         | -(i)t                        |

The initial /i/ is only used when using the definite articles as a
suffix would cause a consonant cluster forbidden by Eittlandic
phonology, otherwise it is omitted. An example of the former case is
with /vatn/ (/water/) which becomes /vatnits/ when in its definite singular
genitive form, while /øy/ (/island/) becomes /øyns/ in the same form. Like
the indefinite article, the suffix agrees in gender, agreeing either
with strong masculine or feminine words (or as established before,
strong common) or with strong neuter and weak nouns.

The use of definite articles with nouns is further discussed in
[[file:grammar.md#definiteness][Definiteness]].

*** Definiteness
Definiteness in Eittlandic serves multiple purposes. Its most obvious
one is to distinguish between an indefinite and a definite entity, as
in English /a dog/ or /the dog/, respectively /einn hundr/ and /hundinn/, as
discussed in [[file:grammar.md#articles-and-demonstratives][Articles and Demonstratives]].

However, definiteness is also necessary with suffixed possessives and
demonstrative.

*** Possessives
# - How are possessors expressed in the noun phrase?
# - Do nouns agree with their possessors? Do possessors agree with
#   possessed nouns? Neither, or both?
# - Is there a distinction between alienable and inalienable
#   possesson?
# - Are there other types of possession?
# - When the possessor is a full noun, where does it usually come with
#   respect to the possessed noun?
*** Gender
# - Is there a noun class system?
# - What are the classes and how are they manifested in the noun
#   phrase?
# - What dimension of reality is most central to the noun class system
#   (e.g. animacy, shape, function, etc.)? What other dimensions are
#   relevant?
# - Do the classifiers occur with numerals? Adjectives? Verbs?
# - What is their function in these contexts?
Eittlandic inherited from Old Norse a gender system divided into three
genders: male, female, and neuter. Although the number of elements
marking it declined during its evolution, Eittlandic still marks
gender in its strong nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and to a certain
degree in its articles. However, as mentioned in [[file:grammar.md#case-marking][Case Marking]], case
marking and by extensions gender marking is slowly disappearing in
Modern Eittlandic nouns and adjectives.

Due to the presence of declensions with strong nouns and adjectives,
its pronouns, and to a certain degree different articles, it can still
be said Eittlandic is a gendered language, although it doesn’t hold
much importance in its grammar any more. Since strong nouns aren’t
productive any more and weak nouns lost all obvious gender
differences, we can even consider gender as not productive any more in
Eittlandic and bound to eventually disappear. In fact, the loss of
gender is even stronger in Standard Eittlandic due to the theoretical
absence of declensions in this dialect.

In case a strong noun is used with a strong adjective, both will agree
in number and gender.
