* Zikãti
Zikãti ({{{phon(d̻͡zikãti)}}}) is an agglutinative language I am currently
working on as an experiment. It doesn’t have any worldbuilding around
it yet and may never have. I’m mostly experimenting with vocabulary
generation with a language relying heavily on affixes modifying the
meaning of a root word.

** Phonology

*** Vowels
- a :: {{{phon(a)}}}
- ã :: {{{phon(ã)}}}
- i :: {{{phon(i)}}}
- u :: {{{phon(u)}}}
- ŋ :: {{{phon(ŋ)}}}
- ɲ :: {{{phon(ɲ)}}}

*** Syllable and word structure
| Group | Consonants                           |
|-------+--------------------------------------|
| C_{1}    | m n g mb nd nz p b t d z k q s h r l |
| C_{2}    | p b t d z k q r h                    |
| V_{1}    | i u ɲ ŋ a ã                          |
| V_{2}    | i u a                                |
| V_{3}    | ɲ ŋ ã                                |

Prefixes follow the [C_{2}]V_{2} phonetic structure, with C_{2} being optional.
Suffixes follow the C_{1}V_{3}[C_{2}] structure with C_{2} being optional.

Roots are a bit more complex, with a C_{1}[V_{3}[C_{2}]C_{1}]V_{2}[C_{2}] structure.

The only consonants that can follow the vowels /ŋ/ and /ɲ/ are non-nasal
plosive consonants. These two vowels cannot follow the consonants /m/,
/n/, or /g/. If such an occurence is created be it while constructing a
word or when they co-occur between words, a dummy {{{phon(u)}}} is added.

A word may contain one or more core roots which affixes cannot
separate but which can aggregate around this word core. A word can
consist of its bare core only, or the core surrounded by affixes. The
amount of prefixes and suffixes is independent from each other.

** Grammar
Zikãti is a nominative and an SOV language, and its verbs are marked
with a marker dedicated to tense and a marked dedicated to aspect and
mood. The verb does not agree with the subject or the object.
